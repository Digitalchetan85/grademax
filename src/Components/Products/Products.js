                Ready mixed refers to concrete that is batched for delivery from
                a central plant instead of being mixed on the job site.
              </p>
              <p className="">
                The primary advantages of using ready mix concrete include: a
                high quality product, lower costs, an eco-friendly process, and
                saving time for your business.
              </p>
              <p className="">
                Ready-mix concrete tends to be better for many projects, in
                spite of its higher cost. Ready-mix concrete offers a higher
                quality, and variation between batches is minimal when concrete
                is prepared in a plant environment. Ready-mix concrete is
                normally recommended for projects that require a high volume.
              </p>
              <p className="">
                Ready mix concrete has cement, aggregates, sand, water and other
                chemicals, which are weigh- batched at a centrally located plant
                for a premium quality. The concrete is then delivered to the
                construction site in transit mixers and can be used straight
                away without any further treatment.

                <p className="">
                  Concrete is basically a mixture of Portland Cement, water and
                  aggregates comprising sand and gravel or crushed stone. In
                  traditional construction sites, each of these materials is
                  procured separately and mixed in specified proportions at site
                  to make concrete.
                </p>
                <p className="">
                  Ready Mixed Concrete, or RMX as it is popularly called, refers
                  to concrete that is specifically manufactured elsewhere and
                  transported in a Transit Mixer for delivery to the customer's
                  construction site in a ready-to-use freshly mixed state. RMX
                  can be custom-made to suit different applications. Ready Mixed
                  Concrete is bought and sold by volume - usually expressed in
                  cubic meters.

                <p className="">
                  Ready Mixed Concrete is manufactured under computer-controlled
                  operations and transported and placed at site using
                  sophisticated equipment and methods. RMX assures its customers
                  numerous benefits.
                </p>
                <p className="">
                  The use of RMX is an environmental friendly practice that
                  ensures a cleaner work place and causes minimal disturbance to
                  its surroundings. This makes its utility more significant in
                  crowded cities and sensitive localities.
                </p>
                <p className="">
                  In contrast to this, conventional methods of making,
                  transporting and placing concrete at most construction sites
                  are somewhat labour-intensive and suffer from practices which
                  may be erratic.

                Ready mix concrete has cement, aggregates, sand, water and other

                away without any further treatment. The automatic plant monitors
                weigh-batching, water-cement ratio, dosage of admixture,
                moisture content, with precision to produce quality concrete.

              <p className="">
                All ingredients used for the preparation of ready mix concrete
                are thoroughly tested for their quality and physical properties
                in a well equipped laboratory attached to the plant for
                conformity to relevant international standard codes. The
                moisture probe determines the water content in the sand and
                aggregates. This accordingly helps in fixing the proportion of
                water to be added for the preparation of the mix. Trial mixes
                are carried out and tested to ensure that each and every batch
                of concrete coming out of the plant meets various mix designs as
                per the client’s requirement with different grades of concrete.

                  <li>
                    Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) allows speedy construction through
                    programmed delivery at site, mechanized operation with
                    consequent economy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    RMC reduces the labour cost and site supervising cost.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    RMC comes with consistency in quality through accurate &
                    computerized control of sand aggregates and water as per mix
                    designs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Production of RMC helps in minimizing cement wastage due to
                    bulk handling.
                  </li>
                  <li>Production of RMC is relatively pollution free.</li>
                  <li>
                    Reduced project time resulting in savings in all aspects.

                  <li>
                    Proper control and economy in use of raw material resulting

                  Disadvantages of Ready Mix Concrete
                </h2>
                <p className="">
                  The materials are batched at a central plant, and the mixing
                  begins at that very plant. So, the travelling time from the
                  plant to the site is critical over longer distances. Some
                  sites are just too far away, which can risk that ready mix
                  concrete may become unusable due to setting.
                </p>
                <p className="">
                  It will generate additional road traffic. Generally, Ready Mix
                  Trucks are large in size and may cover lot of area in the road
                  blocking other traffic. Furthermore, access roads and site
                  access have to be able to carry the greater weight of the
                  ready-mix truck plus load. (Green concrete is approx. 2.5
                  tonne per m³.) This problem can be overcome by utilizing
                  so-called ‘mini mix’ companies which use smaller 4m³ capacity
                  mixers able to reach more-restricted sites.
